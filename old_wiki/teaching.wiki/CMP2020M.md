# Prolog

For the Prolog-based Workshops we'll be using [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/) a widely used Prolog implementation available for most platforms. 

### Installation on Lab Computers

As currently SWI-Prolog is *not* installed on the machines in our CompLabs, your first task is to download and install Prolog. 

1. Go to http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable and download *"SWI-Prolog 6.x.x for Windows XP/Vista/7/8 64-bit edition"*. 
1. Install the downloaded package, choose *"Typical"* as the installation configuration when asked for it.
1. Start Prolog once it is installed from the *Startmenu* (in folder SWI-Prolog).

### Basic use of SWI-Prolog
1. In the file menu choose "New" to open a new file. It will ask for a name of the file. Prolog files end with `.pl`. 
1. Once the filename is given, the filename is opened in the "emacs" editor. You could use any other text editor to edit those files, but the built-in emacs is recommended. 
1. Write your code, and then in the main window choose "Consult" from the "File" Menu to (re-)load your source code. An example file could be:
  ```
  colour(herring, red).
  ```
    
1. Execute any queries in the main windows, e.g. query `colour(X, red)` which should return `X = herring` if the above example has been used.

# AI Planning

For programming in [PDDL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language) and solving AI planning problem, a dedicated ["Fast-Downward" web service](http://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/fast-downward/) has been created and is running on our server. This will be used in the assignment and the workshops.
